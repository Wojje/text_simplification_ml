# The Seq2Seq Model
# =================
#
# A Recurrent Neural Network, or RNN, is a network that operates on a
# sequence and uses its own output as input for subsequent steps.
#
# A `Sequence to Sequence network <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__, or
# seq2seq network, or `Encoder Decoder
# network <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf>`__, is a model
# consisting of two RNNs called the encoder and decoder. The encoder reads
# an input sequence and outputs a single vector, and the decoder reads
# that vector to produce an output sequence.

#
# Unlike sequence prediction with a single RNN, where every input
# corresponds to an output, the seq2seq model frees us from sequence
# length and order, which makes it ideal for translation between two
# languages.
#
# Consider the sentence "Je ne suis pas le chat noir" → "I am not the
# black cat". Most of the words in the input sentence have a direct
# translation in the output sentence, but are in slightly different
# orders, e.g. "chat noir" and "black cat". Because of the "ne/pas"
# construction there is also one more word in the input sentence. It would
# be difficult to produce a correct translation directly from the sequence
# of input words.
#
# With a seq2seq model the encoder creates a single vector which, in the
# ideal case, encodes the "meaning" of the input sequence into a single
# vector — a single point in some N dimensional space of sentences.
#

# The Decoder
# -----------
#
# The decoder is another RNN that takes the encoder output vector(s) and
# outputs a sequence of words to create the translation.

# Simple Decoder
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In the simplest seq2seq decoder we use only last output of the encoder.
# This last output is sometimes called the *context vector* as it encodes
# context from the entire sequence. This context vector is used as the
# initial hidden state of the decoder.
#
# At every step of decoding, the decoder is given an input token and
# hidden state. The initial input token is the start-of-string ``<SOS>``
# token, and the first hidden state is the context vector (the encoder's
# last hidden state).
